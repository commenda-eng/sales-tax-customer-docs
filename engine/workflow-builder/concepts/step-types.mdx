Workflow Builder provides several step types to handle different aspects of your business processes.

## Control flow steps

### START

The entry point of every workflow. Each workflow must have exactly one START step.

- No incoming transitions allowed
- Exactly one outgoing transition required

```
┌─────────┐
│  START  │───▶ (next step)
└─────────┘
```

### END

The terminal point of every workflow. When execution reaches this step, the workflow is complete.

- Exactly one incoming transition required
- No outgoing transitions allowed

```
(previous step) ───▶ ┌─────────┐
                     │   END   │
                     └─────────┘
```

## Human steps

### HUMAN_CONFIRM

A step that waits for human confirmation before the workflow can continue. The assigned person must explicitly mark the step as completed.

**Use cases:**
- Waiting for an agent to complete a manual task
- Requiring approval before proceeding
- Confirming external actions are done

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  HUMAN_CONFIRM  │
│                 │
│  "Verify docs"  │
└─────────────────┘
```

<Note>
Additional human step types like `HUMAN_FORM`, `HUMAN_URL_REDIRECT`, and `HUMAN_DOC_UPLOAD` are planned but not yet implemented.
</Note>

## System steps

### SYS_SUB_WORKFLOW

Triggers another workflow (child workflow) from within the current workflow. Supports two modes:

#### Single mode

Execute one child workflow:

```json
{
  "type": "SYS_SUB_WORKFLOW",
  "mode": "SINGLE",
  "childWorkflowTemplateVersionId": "version-123",
  "inputMapping": [...]
}
```

#### Batch mode

Execute multiple child workflows by iterating over a collection:

```json
{
  "type": "SYS_SUB_WORKFLOW",
  "mode": "BATCH",
  "childWorkflowTemplateVersionId": "version-123",
  "iterable": {
    "type": "EXPRESSION",
    "expr": { "src": "__context__.directors" }
  },
  "inputMapping": [...]
}
```

**Use case:** Trigger multiple DSC workflows from an India Private Incorporation workflow, one for each director.

## Gateway steps

Gateways control the flow of execution through branching and merging.

### GATEWAY_PARALLEL_SPLIT

Branches the workflow into multiple paths that execute simultaneously.

```
                    ┌───▶ Path A ───┐
                    │               │
───▶ [PARALLEL] ────┼───▶ Path B ───┼───▶
     [  SPLIT  ]    │               │
                    └───▶ Path C ───┘
```

- All outgoing paths start at the same time
- Must be paired with a GATEWAY_PARALLEL_JOIN

### GATEWAY_PARALLEL_JOIN

Waits for all incoming parallel branches to complete before proceeding.

```
     Path A ───┐
               │
     Path B ───┼───▶ [PARALLEL] ───▶
               │     [  JOIN   ]
     Path C ───┘
```

- Requires at least 2 incoming transitions
- Exactly 1 outgoing transition

### GATEWAY_EXCLUSIVE_SPLIT

A yes/no decision point where exactly one path is taken based on a condition.

```
                    ┌───▶ Yes path (condition = true)
                    │
───▶ [EXCLUSIVE] ───┤
     [  SPLIT  ]    │
                    └───▶ No path (default)
```

**Requirements:**
- Exactly 2 outgoing transitions
- One transition must have a condition
- One transition must be marked as default

**Example condition:**

```jsonata
__context__.customer.verified = true
```

### GATEWAY_INCLUSIVE_SPLIT

A flexible decision point where multiple paths can be taken based on conditions.

```
                    ┌───▶ Path A (if condition A)
                    │
───▶ [INCLUSIVE] ───┼───▶ Path B (if condition B)
     [  SPLIT  ]    │
                    └───▶ Default path
```

**Use case:** Send different notifications based on user attributes:
- If user is new → send onboarding email
- If user is premium → send perks notification
- If both conditions are true → do both

## Step configuration

All steps share these base properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique identifier within the workflow |
| `type` | The step type |
| `name` | Human-readable label |
| `outputSchema` | JSON Schema for step output validation |
| `group` | Grouping metadata (groupId, order) |
| `activationPolicy` | Default runtime activation state |
| `ui.reactFlow.position` | Visual editor coordinates (x, y) |

## Step groups

Steps can be organized into logical groups for UI presentation:

```json
{
  "stepGroups": [
    {
      "id": "group-verification",
      "name": "Verification",
      "stepIds": ["step-1", "step-2", "step-3"]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Warning>
START, END, and gateway steps cannot be added to groups. Only human and system steps can be grouped.
</Warning>
