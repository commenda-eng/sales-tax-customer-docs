This guide walks you through creating, publishing, and activating your first workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Admin Portal
- Appropriate permissions for workflow management

## Step 1: Access workflow management

1. Go to the **Admin Portal**
2. In the left sidebar, scroll to the bottom and click **Workflow Management**
3. You'll see a page listing all existing workflows
4. At the top right, you'll find two tabs:
   - **Workflow Links** - Configure triggers
   - **Create Workflow** - Create new templates

## Step 2: Create a workflow template

1. Click **Create Workflow**
2. In the modal that appears, enter:
   - **Workflow name** - A descriptive name for your workflow
   - Other optional fields as needed
3. Click **Create** to add the new workflow
4. The new workflow appears in the workflows table

## Step 3: Create a version

1. Click any row in the workflow list to open the **Workflow Detail Page**
2. Click **Add Version** (top right)
3. In the modal, enter:
   - **Version number** - Semantic version (e.g., "1.0.0")
   - **Starter version** (optional) - Copy from an existing version
4. Click **Create** to generate the new version
5. The system opens the **Workflow Editor**

## Step 4: Design your workflow

Inside the editor, you'll see:

- **Steps Panel** (left) - All available step types
- **Canvas** (center) - Drag and drop steps here
- **Configuration Panel** (right) - Appears when you click any step

### Add steps

1. Drag a step type from the Steps Panel onto the Canvas
2. Click the step to configure it in the Configuration Panel
3. Connect steps by dragging from output handles to input handles

### Configure transitions

1. Click on a transition line to select it
2. For conditional gateways, set the condition expression
3. Mark one transition as the default for exclusive/inclusive splits

<Warning>
There is no autosave. Save your progress frequently using the **Save** button (top right).
</Warning>

## Step 5: Publish your version

1. Review your workflow design
2. Click **Publish** (top right)
3. The version status changes from **Draft** to **Published**

<Note>
Newly created versions start in **Draft** status. Publishing makes the version eligible to be activated.
</Note>

## Step 6: Activate the version

1. Return to the workflow's versions list
2. Find the published version
3. Click **Activate Version**
4. This version is now used whenever this workflow is triggered

## Step 7: Create workflow links

Workflow links determine how and when a workflow is triggered.

### Access workflow links

1. Go to the main workflow page
2. Click the **Workflow Links** tab
3. View, edit, or delete existing links

### Create a new link

1. Click **Add Link**
2. In the modal, select:
   - **Workflow Template** - Choose from all templates
   - **Link Type**:
     - **Service Request Type** - Trigger on specific service requests
     - **Product ID** - Trigger when a product is purchased
   - **Identifier** - The specific service request type or product ID
3. Click **Save**

<Tip>
When a matching service request is created or a product with the specified ID is purchased, the system automatically generates and starts the workflow.
