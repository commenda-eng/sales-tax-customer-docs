The Workflow Builder is a powerful visual tool for creating and managing automated workflows that orchestrate your business processes. It enables you to define complex multi-step processes, handle conditional logic, and integrate with external systems.

## What is Workflow Builder?

Workflow Builder allows you to:

- **Design visual workflows** using a drag-and-drop canvas interface
- **Define step types** including human tasks, system operations, and decision gateways
- **Create conditional logic** with exclusive and inclusive branching
- **Orchestrate sub-workflows** for modular, reusable process design
- **Manage versions** with draft, published, and active states

## Step types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **START** | Entry point of the workflow (exactly one required) |
| **END** | Terminal point of the workflow (exactly one required) |
| **HUMAN_CONFIRM** | Waits for human confirmation before continuing |
| **SYS_SUB_WORKFLOW** | Triggers child workflows (single or batch mode) |
| **GATEWAY_PARALLEL_SPLIT** | Branches into multiple parallel paths |
| **GATEWAY_PARALLEL_JOIN** | Waits for all parallel branches to complete |
| **GATEWAY_EXCLUSIVE_SPLIT** | Yes/no decision point (one path taken) |
| **GATEWAY_INCLUSIVE_SPLIT** | Multiple paths based on conditions |

## Workflow lifecycle

1. **Create template** - Define a new workflow template with name and description
2. **Add version** - Create a version in draft status
3. **Design workflow** - Use the visual editor to add steps and transitions
4. **Publish version** - Mark the version ready for activation
5. **Activate version** - Set as the active version for new executions
6. **Link triggers** - Connect to service request types or products
