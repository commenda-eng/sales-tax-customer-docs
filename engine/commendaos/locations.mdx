## Location types

A single location can have multiple types:

| Type | Description | Use case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `REGISTERED_OFFICE` | Official legal address on file with authorities | Required for corporate filings |
| `OPERATING` | Primary business operations location | Main office or headquarters |
| `MAILING` | Correspondence address | Where mail is received |
| `HEADQUARTERS` | Main administrative office | Corporate HQ |
| `POINT_OF_SALE` | Retail or customer-facing location | Stores, showrooms |
| `WAREHOUSE` | Inventory storage facility | Distribution centers |
| `BRANCH` | Secondary office location | Regional offices |
| `EMPLOYEE_WORK_LOCATION` | Where staff are based | Remote offices, coworking spaces |

## Address fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `addressLine1` | string | Yes | Street address |
| `addressLine2` | string | No | Apartment, suite, unit, building, floor |
| `city` | string | Yes | City or locality |
| `state` | string | Conditional | State/province (required for US, Canada, India, Australia) |
| `postalCode` | string | Yes | ZIP/postal code |
| `country` | string | Yes | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code |

## Employee tracking

Track employee count at each location for:
- Payroll tax nexus determination
- Workers' compensation requirements
- Local tax obligations
- Headcount reporting

Update `employeeCount` as staff levels change.

## Nexus determination

Use `startDate` to track when physical presence began in a jurisdiction. This is critical for:
- Sales tax nexus
- Income tax nexus
- Payroll tax obligations
- Registration requirements

## Location sources

Locations can be created from multiple sources:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `COMMENDA` | Manually entered in CommendaOS |
| `GUSTO` | Synced from Gusto payroll |
| `RIPPLING` | Synced from Rippling HRIS |
| `JUSTWORKS` | Synced from Justworks |
| `DEEL` | Synced from Deel |

External locations include a `sourceId` for reference back to the originating system.

## Time periods

Track location validity with `startDate` and `endDate`:
- `startDate`: When the location became active (required)
- `endDate`: When the location was closed (optional, null for active locations)

This enables historical tracking of where entities operated over time.
