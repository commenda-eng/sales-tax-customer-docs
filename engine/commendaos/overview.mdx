## Overview

CommendaOS is Commenda's comprehensive data modeling system for managing business entity information across jurisdictions worldwide. It provides a unified API for modeling, storing, and retrieving entity data including government identifiers, registrations, locations, credentials, and documents.

## Core concepts

### Business entity

The central model representing a legal business entity (corporation, LLC, partnership, etc.) operating in any jurisdiction. Business entities contain:

- **General information**: Legal name, DBA name, business description, formation date
- **Jurisdiction details**: Incorporation country, jurisdiction, entity type
- **Addresses**: Registered office, operating, and mailing addresses
- **Tax information**: Fiscal year, accounting basis, tax classification

### Government identifiers

Official identification numbers issued by government authorities for business entities. Examples include:

- **US**: EIN (Employer Identification Number), state entity numbers
- **India**: PAN, TAN, GSTIN, CIN/LLPIN
- **UK**: Company Registration Number, UTR, VAT Number, PAYE Number
- **Canada**: Business Number, Corporation Number, Company Key
- **Singapore**: UEN, GST Number, CPF Submission Number
- **UAE**: License Number, TRN
- **Australia**: ACN, ABN, TFN, GST Number
- **Germany**: HRB Number, Steuernummer, VAT Number
- **France**: SIREN, Corporate Tax Number, TVA Number

Each identifier includes:
- Display name and description
- Validation rules (regex patterns)
- Supporting document requirements
- Purpose (formation, taxation, payroll, etc.)
- Function criticality level

### Registrations

Formal registrations with government agencies that enable business operations. Common registration types:

- **Indirect tax**: VAT/GST/sales tax registration
- **Payroll**: Employer withholding and unemployment insurance
- **Social security**: Employee benefit programs
- **Trade**: Import/export licenses
- **Corporate registry**: Access credentials for filing systems

Registrations can be:
- **Domestic**: For entities formed in the jurisdiction
- **Foreign**: For entities qualified to do business from another jurisdiction
- **Expirable**: Some registrations require renewal

### Locations

Physical addresses where business entities operate, categorized by type:

- **Registered office address**: Official legal address on file with authorities
- **Operating address**: Primary business operations location
- **Mailing address**: Correspondence address
- **Headquarters**: Main administrative office
- **Point of sale**: Retail or customer-facing locations
- **Warehouse**: Inventory storage facilities

- **Banking portals**: Financial institution access

Credentials consist of:
- **Plain text blocks**: Usernames, account numbers, identifiers
