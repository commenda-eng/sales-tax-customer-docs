## Transactions

Commenda provides a range of endpoints to manage transactions:

1. `/calculate` endpoint:

   - Used to estimate sales tax for a potential transaction.
   - The response includes the calculated tax amount.

2. `/transactions` endpoints:
   - Used to submit completed transactions to our system.
   - Commenda uses this data to file sales tax in states where the seller is registered and track the seller's progress towards nexus.

3. `/nexus` endpoint:
   - Used to view the seller's progress towards sales tax nexus.

4. `/registrations` endpoints:
   - Used to manage sales tax registrations.
   - Commenda uses information about registrations on the `/calculate` endpoint to determine if tax should be collected on transactions.

5. `/filings` endpoints:
    - View the contents and status of a seller's periodic sales tax filings.

## Typical Usage

While the `/calculate` and `/transactions` endpoints can be used independently, a typical workflow is as follows:

<ol>
  <li>
    {" "}
    A customer visits your website, adds something to their cart, and clicks 'check
    out'.
  </li>
  <li>
    {" "}
    You call our `/calculate` API to determine the correct amount of sales tax to charge the customer.
  </li>
  <li>
    {" "}
    The customer pays the total amount, including the sales tax. You save the transaction details, including the subtotal and tax amount.
  </li>
  <li>
    {" "}
    After the transaction is completed, you call the `/transactions` API to submit the transaction details to our system.
  </li>
</ol>

## Discounts

Typically, discounts are treated as a reduction in the overall sales price. To account for this, simply call our `/calculate` and `/transactions` endpoints using the post-discount price as the `amount` and `subtotal`.

For accounting purposes, some customers may prefer to recognize the full sale amount and treat the discount as an expense. If you need this setup, please contact the Commenda team.
