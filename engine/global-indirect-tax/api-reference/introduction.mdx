## Base URL

All API endpoints use the following base URL:

```
https://transaction-tax.api.in.commenda.io/api/v1
```

All endpoint paths documented in this reference are relative to this base URL. For example, the tax calculation endpoint `POST /calculate` should be called as:

```
POST https://transaction-tax.api.in.commenda.io/api/v1/calculate
```

## Authentication

We implement Bearer token authentication to secure our APIs. This method requires you to include a valid token in the Authorization header of each request. The format is as follows:

```json
"Authorization": "Bearer <your_token>"
```

Replace `<your_token>` with the actual token provided to you by Commenda.

Request API keys from the Commenda team for both testing and production.
