description: "Archive a registration to stop tax calculations and hide from views"
---

Archive a registration to completely exclude it from tax calculations and hide it from default list views. Archived registrations are preserved for historical records but no longer participate in tax processing.

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="registration_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier (UUID) of the registration to archive.
</ParamField>

## What Happens When You Archive

- **Tax calculations stop** — The registration is no longer considered when calculating taxes for transactions
- **Hidden from views** — Excluded from list results unless you set `include_archived: true`
- **Data preserved** — All historical data remains intact for reference and auditing

### Cascade Behavior

| Registration Type | Effect |
|-------------------|--------|
| **State registration** | Archives the state **and all local registrations** (cities, counties, districts) under it |
| **Local registration** | Archives only the local registration (no cascade) |

<Warning>
  Archiving a state registration will automatically archive all local registrations under that state. This is a bulk operation that cannot be partially undone.
</Warning>

## When to Archive

Use archive when you want to:

- **Completely disable a registration** — Stop all tax calculations without deleting historical data
- **Remove duplicates** — Archive an erroneously created duplicate
- **Clean up test data** — Hide test registrations while preserving them for reference

## Archive vs. Close vs. Delete

| Action | Use Case | Tax Calculations | Reversible |
|--------|----------|------------------|------------|
| **Archive** | Completely disable | **Stopped entirely** | Yes (contact support) |
| **Close** | Stop selling on a specific date | Active within date range (start → end date) | No |
| **Delete** | Remove entirely | N/A - data removed | No |

<Note>
  If you need to stop collecting tax starting from a specific date but preserve calculations for the historical period, use [Close](/api-reference/global-indirect-tax/registrations/registrations-id-close-POST) instead. Close keeps the registration active for transactions within the effective date range.
</Note>

## Viewing Archived Registrations

To include archived registrations in list results, set `include_archived: true`:

```json
POST /registrations/list
{
  "corporation_id": "your-corp-id",
  "include_archived": true
}
```

Archived registrations will have a non-null `archived_at` timestamp.

<RequestExample>
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://transaction-tax.api.in.commenda.io/api/v1/registrations/7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7/archive' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>'
```
</RequestExample>
