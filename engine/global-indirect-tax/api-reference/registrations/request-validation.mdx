title: "Request Validation"
api: "POST https://transaction-tax.api.in.commenda.io/api/v1/registrations/{registration_id}/request-validation"
description: "Request Commenda to validate your registration credentials and begin automated filing"
---

Request validation of a registration to enable automated tax filing. Once validated, Commenda will automatically file returns and remit payments on your behalf.

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="registration_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier (UUID) of the registration to validate.
</ParamField>

## Before Requesting Validation

Ensure your registration includes:

1. **Tax registration ID** — Your state-issued permit number or account number
2. **Portal credentials** — `portal_id` and `credential_id` for the state's tax portal
3. **Frequency** — Filing frequency for the jurisdiction
4. **Effective start date** — When the registration became effective

<Note>
  Missing any required information will cause validation to fail. Use [Get Registration](/api-reference/global-indirect-tax/registrations/registrations-id-GET) to check what's been provided, and [Update Registration](/api-reference/global-indirect-tax/registrations/registrations-id-POST) to add missing fields.
</Note>

<Info>
  Need to know what portal credentials are required? Use the [Portal Fields](/api-reference/global-indirect-tax/registrations/content/portal-fields-POST) endpoint to get the credential requirements for your registration.
</Info>

## What Happens During Validation

When you call this endpoint, Commenda will:

1. **Verify your tax registration** — Confirm your tax ID is valid with the state
2. **Test portal credentials** — Log into the state's tax portal to verify access
3. **Configure for filing** — Set up the account for automated filing

The `validation_status` will change from `PENDING` to `VALIDATION_IN_PROGRESS`.

## Validation Outcomes

### Success: `validation_status: VALID`

Your registration is validated and ready for automated filing:
- `auto_filing_status` will change to `FILING`
- Commenda will file returns at the end of each filing period

### Failure: `validation_status: INVALID`

Something went wrong during validation. Common issues:
- Invalid tax registration ID
- Incorrect portal credentials
- Account not configured correctly with the state

Check the registration for error details and update the registration to correct the issues, then request validation again.

## Monitoring Validation Progress

Poll the registration using [Get Registration](/api-reference/global-indirect-tax/registrations/registrations-id-GET) to check status:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://transaction-tax.api.in.commenda.io/api/v1/registrations/7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>'
```

The `validation_status` field will show:
- `VALIDATION_IN_PROGRESS` — Validation is underway
- `VALID` — Validation succeeded
- `INVALID` — Validation failed (check for error details)

<RequestExample>
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://transaction-tax.api.in.commenda.io/api/v1/registrations/7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7/request-validation' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>'
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json 200 - Validation Started
{
  "message": "Successfully started validation process for your registration."
}
```

```json 200 - Already In Progress
{
  "message": "Validation is already in progress."
}
```

```json 404 - Not Found
{
  "error": {
    "type": "REGISTRATION_NOT_FOUND",
    "title": "Registration not found.",
    "status": 404,
    "instance": "/api/v1/registrations/7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7/request-validation"
  }
}
```

```json 500 - Validation Failed to Start
{
  "message": "Failed to request validation.",
  "error": {
    "type": "SERVER_INTERNAL_ERROR",
    "title": "Failed to request validation.",
    "detail": "Unable to initiate validation. Please ensure all required fields are provided.",
    "status": 500,
    "instance": "/api/v1/registrations/7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7/request-validation"
  }
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Next Steps

After validation succeeds:

1. **Start collecting tax** — Use the `/calculate` endpoint to get accurate tax amounts
2. **Record transactions** — Submit completed transactions via the `/transactions` endpoint
3. **Monitor filings** — Use the `/filings` endpoints to track filing status
4. **Check for issues** — Subscribe to registration webhooks to be notified of any problems
