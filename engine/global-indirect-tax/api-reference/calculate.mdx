## Overview

The `/calculate` endpoint allows you to determine the amount of sales tax to charge on a transaction. By providing details such as customer information, line items, and pricing, you'll receive accurate tax calculations based on applicable jurisdictions and rates.

## Factors Affecting Tax Rates

Our system considers the following factors to determine the appropriate tax for a transaction:

1. **Seller Information**

   - **State Registrations**:
     - If your corporation is not registered to pay taxes in a state, the `/calculate` endpoint will return a tax amount of 0 for that state.
     - If your corporation is registered in a state, we calculate the tax amount based on that state's rates and rules.

2. **Product-Specific Information**

   - **Product Taxability**:
     - **Product Configuration**: Each corporation can define and manage its product catalog via our `/products` endpoints. (Coming soon)
     - **Product Code Assignment**: For every product in the catalog, you can assign a specific product code using the API.
     - **Tax Rate Computation**: When the `/calculate` endpoint is called, each line item includes a product id. We use this id to retrieve the pre-configured product code for that product, determining its taxability for the transaction.
       - If a product is classified as non-taxable based on its product code, the tax amount for that specific line item will be 0.
       - If a product is taxable, the tax is calculated based on the product's price and applicable tax rates.

3. **Customer Information**
   - **Shipping Address**: We compute the tax rate based on the shipping address provided for each transaction.
   - **Customer Exemptions**: Transactions can be exempted from sales tax based on properties of the customer making the purchase. You can read more about these exemptions [here](/api-reference/global-indirect-tax/core-concepts/exemptions#purpose-exemptions).

## Sample Calculation Object

The `/calculate` endpoint returns a JSON object containing the transaction details and calculated taxes.
