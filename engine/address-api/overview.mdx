The Address API is a geocoding service that converts addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and standardizes address components. It uses Google's Geocoding API as the underlying provider and includes caching to optimize performance and reduce costs.

## Key features

- **Geocoding**: Convert addresses to geographic coordinates
- **Address standardization**: Parse and normalize address components
- **Caching**: Automatic caching of geocoding results
- **Provider transparency**: Access to both normalized results and raw provider responses
