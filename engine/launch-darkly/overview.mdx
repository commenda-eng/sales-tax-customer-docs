title: LaunchDarkly feature flags
description: Control feature rollouts across environments without deployments
---

LaunchDarkly enables feature flagging to control whether specific features are enabled or disabled across different environments (`dev`, `staging`, `production`) without requiring a new deployment.

## How it works

Each LaunchDarkly project contains multiple environments, and each environment has its own SDK key. The SDK key must match the environment in which the backend service is running.

## Creating a feature flag

1. Create a new flag in LaunchDarkly
2. Assign a unique flag key (e.g., `enable-new-checkout-flow`)
3. Configure targeting rules for each environment

## Using flags in code

Reference the flag key in your backend code using the global feature flag module:

```typescript
import { featureFlags } from '@commenda/feature-flags';

// Check if a feature is enabled
const isEnabled = await featureFlags.evaluate('enable-new-checkout-flow', {
  userId: user.id,
  environment: process.env.ENVIRONMENT
});

if (isEnabled) {
  // New feature logic
} else {
  // Existing behavior
}
```

The module initializes the LaunchDarkly SDK with the correct environment SDK key and evaluates the flag at runtime.

## Best practices

- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive flag keys (e.g., `enable-feature-name` or `rollout-feature-name`)
- **Environment targeting**: Configure proper targeting rules for each environment
- **Safe fallbacks**: Always define fallback behavior when flag evaluation fails
- **Clean up**: Remove flags and associated code once a feature is fully rolled out

## Flag cleanup process

After a feature has been released using a feature flag, the flag must be cleaned up within **7 days** to avoid long-term technical debt.

### Automated tracking

The backend is configured to automatically track all issues labeled as `feature flag`. When such an issue is marked as done:

1. The system automatically creates a sub-issue for flag cleanup
2. The sub-issue is scheduled for 7 days later
3. The sub-issue is assigned to the same assignee as the parent issue

### Cleanup responsibilities

The assignee must complete the following within the 7-day window:

- Remove the flag check from the codebase
- Delete the flag from LaunchDarkly (if no longer needed)
- Ensure no stale conditional logic remains

<Warning>
Temporary flags that are not cleaned up become permanent maintenance overhead. Always complete cleanup within the 7-day deadline.
