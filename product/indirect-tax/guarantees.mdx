## Overview

Commenda provides two service guarantees for indirect tax services: the Accuracy Guarantee and the On-Time Filing Guarantee. These guarantees protect customers from financial exposure due to Commenda's errors, subject to specific conditions and caps.

Both guarantees are capped at the **Rolling ACV** - the fees paid to Commenda for the Services during the twelve (12) months preceding the tax period at issue.

## Accuracy guarantee

### What's covered

If you properly configure and use the Services and Commenda's tax calculation, rate, or taxability determination is inaccurate such that your return is filed incorrectly and a tax authority assesses uncollected sales tax, penalties, or interest (collectively, "Tax Shortfall"), Commenda will reimburse or credit you for the Tax Shortfall.

### Coverage cap

Reimbursement is capped at the **Rolling ACV** - the fees you paid to Commenda during the twelve (12) months preceding the tax period at issue.

### How it works

#### Step 1: Receive assessment notice

You receive a notice from a tax authority assessing uncollected sales tax, penalties, or interest due to an inaccuracy in Commenda's tax calculation, rate, or taxability determination.

#### Step 2: Notify Commenda (within 14 days)

You must notify Commenda in writing within **fourteen (14) days** after receiving the first notice of assessment.

**Required information:**
- Copy of the assessment notice
- Tax period(s) affected
- Jurisdiction(s) involved
- Amount assessed (tax, penalties, interest)
- Description of the transactions at issue

**How to notify:**
- Email: [support contact]
- Subject line: "Accuracy Guarantee Claim - [Your Company Name]"
- Include all required documentation

#### Step 3: Cooperate with investigation

You must provide all relevant information and reasonably cooperate with Commenda's investigation and any effort to contest or mitigate the assessment.

**This includes:**
- Transaction data and records
- Configuration settings used
- Communication with tax authority
- Supporting documentation requested by Commenda
- Participation in calls or meetings as needed
- Authorization for Commenda to communicate with tax authority (if needed)

#### Step 4: Commenda investigates

Commenda will:
- Review the assessment and underlying transactions
- Verify whether the error was due to Commenda's calculation, rate, or taxability determination
- Determine if all guarantee conditions are met
- Assess whether the assessment can be contested or mitigated
- Calculate the covered amount (up to Rolling ACV cap)

#### Step 5: Resolution

If the guarantee applies, Commenda will:
- Reimburse you for the covered Tax Shortfall, or
- Apply a credit to your account for the covered amount

**Timeline:** Commenda will make a determination and provide reimbursement or credit within a reasonable timeframe after completing the investigation.

### What's NOT covered

The Accuracy Guarantee does not apply to errors caused by:

#### 1. Customer's incorrect or incomplete data or configurations

**Examples:**
- Wrong addresses provided
- Incorrect product taxability mappings
- Missing or invalid exemption certificates
- Incorrect nexus settings
- Wrong customer classifications
- Incomplete transaction data

**Why it matters:** Commenda's calculations are only as accurate as the data provided. If you provide incorrect information or misconfigure the system, the guarantee doesn't apply.

#### 2. Legal positions or classifications selected by customer

**Examples:**
- Customer chooses to treat a product as non-taxable when it's actually taxable
- Customer selects a specific tax treatment based on their legal interpretation
- Customer decides not to collect tax in a jurisdiction where they have nexus
- Customer applies an exemption based on their legal position

**Why it matters:** When you make legal or classification decisions, you own the outcome. Commenda provides tools and guidance, but ultimate responsibility for legal positions rests with you.

#### 3. Changes in law after the transaction date

**Examples:**
- Tax rate increases after transaction but before filing
- New taxability rules enacted retroactively
- Jurisdiction changes sourcing rules
- New exemption requirements imposed

**Why it matters:** Commenda maintains current tax content, but cannot predict or be responsible for retroactive legal changes.

#### 4. Events outside Commenda's reasonable control

**Examples:**
- Third-party service failures (geocoding, address validation)
- Force majeure events
- Customer's system failures affecting data transmission
- Tax authority system errors
- Jurisdiction provides incorrect guidance

**Why it matters:** Commenda cannot guarantee against events beyond our control.

### Sole and exclusive remedy

The remedies in the Accuracy Guarantee are your sole and exclusive remedies for inaccuracies in tax calculations or content. This means:

- You cannot seek additional damages beyond the Rolling ACV cap
- You cannot pursue other legal remedies for covered inaccuracies
- The guarantee represents the full extent of Commenda's liability for calculation errors

## On-time filing guarantee

### What's covered

If you have met all your obligations and Commenda fails to file a sales tax return by its statutory due date solely due to Commenda's error, Commenda will:

1. **Complete and submit the delinquent filing** at no additional charge
2. **Waive or refund any service fee** for that return
3. **Pay any late-filing penalties and interest** imposed by the tax authority, up to the Rolling ACV cap

### Coverage cap

Payment of penalties and interest is capped at the **Rolling ACV** - the fees you paid to Commenda during the twelve (12) months preceding the tax period at issue.

### How it works

#### Step 1: Discover missed deadline

You discover that a return was not filed by its statutory due date, or you receive a penalty notice from a tax authority for late filing.

#### Step 2: Notify Commenda (within 10 days)

You must notify Commenda within **ten (10) days** of discovering the missed deadline or receiving a penalty notice to qualify for the guarantee.

**Required information:**
- Jurisdiction and tax type
- Filing period
- Statutory due date
- Date you discovered the issue or received penalty notice
- Copy of penalty notice (if applicable)

**How to notify:**
- Email: [support contact]
- Subject line: "On-Time Filing Guarantee Claim - [Your Company Name]"
- Include all required documentation

#### Step 3: Commenda investigates

Commenda will:
- Verify the statutory due date
- Review the filing timeline and any communications
- Determine if the late filing was solely due to Commenda's error
- Verify that you met all your obligations
- Assess whether any exclusions apply

#### Step 4: Resolution

If the guarantee applies, Commenda will:
1. **Immediately file the delinquent return** (if not already filed)
2. **Waive or refund the service fee** for that return
3. **Pay the late-filing penalties and interest** (up to Rolling ACV cap)

### Your obligations (Section 2 requirements)

To qualify for the On-Time Filing Guarantee, you must have met all obligations, which typically include:

#### Timely data provision

- Provide complete and accurate transaction data by agreed-upon deadlines
- Respond to data quality issues or questions promptly
- Ensure data feeds or integrations are functioning properly

#### Sufficient funds

- Maintain sufficient funds in your account for tax payments
- Provide payment authorization in advance of due dates
- Respond to payment issues promptly

#### Required tax accounts

- Maintain active tax registration accounts in all required jurisdictions
- Provide Commenda with current login credentials or filing authorization

- Review and approve returns by agreed-upon deadlines
- Respond to questions or issues that require your input
- Provide necessary documentation when requested

#### Accurate configuration

- Maintain accurate nexus settings
- Keep product taxability mappings current

### What's NOT covered

The On-Time Filing Guarantee does not apply to late filings caused by:

#### 1. Customer's delayed or inaccurate data

**Examples:**
- Transaction data provided after the deadline
- Incomplete or incorrect transaction data requiring correction
- Data quality issues that delay processing
- Integration failures on customer's side

**Why it matters:** Commenda cannot file returns without complete, accurate data. Late data provision shifts responsibility to you.

#### 2. Insufficient funds

**Examples:**
- Insufficient balance for tax payment
- Payment authorization not provided
- Payment method declined or failed
- Customer delays payment approval

**Why it matters:** Returns cannot be filed without payment. Ensuring sufficient funds is your responsibility.

#### 3. Failure to maintain required tax accounts

**Examples:**
- Tax registration account suspended or closed
- Login credentials expired or invalid
- Filing authorization revoked or expired
- Account locked due to prior issues

**Why it matters:** Commenda cannot file to accounts that are not active and accessible.

#### 4. Events outside Commenda's reasonable control

**Examples:**
- Tax authority system outages on filing deadline
- Force majeure events
- Third-party service failures
- Jurisdiction changes filing requirements without notice

**Why it matters:** Commenda cannot guarantee against events beyond our control.

#### 5. Customer delays in approvals or responses

**Examples:**
- Return approval delayed past internal deadline
- Questions or issues not addressed timely
- Required documentation not provided
- Customer unavailable during critical filing window

**Why it matters:** Filing deadlines require timely customer participation. Delays on your end shift responsibility to you.

**Guarantee applies?** Yes, if:
- You provided correct address and transaction data
- You properly configured the system
- You notify within 14 days
- You cooperate with investigation

**Covered amount:** $5,500 (tax + penalties + interest), up to Rolling ACV cap

### Scenario 2: Wrong product taxability

**Situation:** You classified a product as non-taxable based on your legal interpretation. Tax authority disagrees and assesses $10,000.

**Guarantee applies?** No - this is a legal position selected by customer (exclusion #2)

**Your responsibility:** You own the outcome of legal classification decisions

### Scenario 3: Late filing due to customer data delay

**Situation:** You provided transaction data 3 days late. Commenda filed the return 2 days after the due date. Tax authority assesses $200 in late-filing penalties.

**Guarantee applies?** No - late filing was caused by customer's delayed data (exclusion #1)

**Your responsibility:** You're responsible for penalties due to your data delay

### Scenario 4: Late filing due to Commenda error

**Situation:** You provided all data on time and approved the return 5 days before the due date. Commenda failed to submit the return due to an internal processing error. Tax authority assesses $300 in penalties.

**Guarantee applies?** Yes, if:
- You met all obligations (timely data, approval, sufficient funds)
- You notify within 10 days
- Late filing was solely due to Commenda's error

**Covered amount:** $300 in penalties + fee waiver for that return, up to Rolling ACV cap

### Scenario 5: Incorrect address provided

**Situation:** You provided a billing address instead of shipping address. Commenda calculated tax for the wrong jurisdiction. Tax authority assesses $3,000 in uncollected tax.

**Guarantee applies?** No - this is customer's incorrect data (exclusion #1)

**Your responsibility:** You're responsible for providing correct addresses

### Scenario 6: Retroactive law change

**Situation:** A jurisdiction retroactively changed a product's taxability. Commenda's calculation was correct at the time of transaction but is now deemed incorrect. Tax authority assesses $8,000.

**Guarantee applies?** No - this is a change in law after the transaction date (exclusion #3)

**Your responsibility:** Retroactive law changes are not covered by the guarantee

## Frequently asked questions

### What is "Rolling ACV"?

Rolling ACV is the total fees you paid to Commenda for the Services during the twelve (12) months preceding the tax period at issue. This is the cap for both guarantees.

**Example:** If the tax period at issue is Q2 2024, Rolling ACV is the fees you paid from Q2 2023 through Q1 2024.

### Can I get more than Rolling ACV in coverage?

No. Both guarantees are capped at Rolling ACV. This is your maximum recovery under either guarantee.

### What if I disagree with Commenda's determination?

If you believe the guarantee should apply but Commenda determines it doesn't, you should:
1. Request a detailed explanation of the determination
2. Provide any additional information that supports your position
3. Escalate to executive team if needed
4. Review your service agreement for dispute resolution procedures

### Do the guarantees cover state income tax or other taxes?

No. These guarantees specifically cover sales tax (indirect tax) services only. They do not cover income tax, payroll tax, or other tax types.

### What if multiple issues occur in the same period?

Each issue is evaluated separately. However, the total recovery across all issues is still capped at Rolling ACV for that period.

### How long does the investigation take?

Investigation timelines vary based on complexity. Commenda will:
- Acknowledge your claim within 2 business days
- Provide initial assessment within 10 business days
- Complete investigation within 30 days (for most cases)
- Communicate timeline if more time is needed

### What if the tax authority is wrong?

If Commenda believes the tax authority's assessment is incorrect, we will:
- Work with you to contest the assessment
- Provide supporting documentation and analysis
- Participate in appeals or protests (as appropriate)
- Help minimize or eliminate the assessment

If the assessment is successfully reduced or eliminated, the guarantee covers only the final assessed amount.

### Can I purchase additional coverage?

The guarantees are included with your service agreement and cannot be increased beyond Rolling ACV. However, you may want to consider:
- Maintaining your own tax liability insurance
- Increasing your Rolling ACV by using more Commenda services
- Working with your insurance broker on additional coverage

### What happens if Commenda goes out of business?

The guarantees are only valid while Commenda is operating. Consider:
- Maintaining your own documentation and records
- Having backup tax service providers identified
- Maintaining tax liability insurance
- Keeping sufficient reserves for potential tax liabilities
