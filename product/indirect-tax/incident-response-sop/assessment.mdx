## Overview

This framework provides structured criteria for assessing incidents and determining appropriate response levels. Use these dimensions to classify incidents and guide decision-making.

## Assessment dimensions

### 1. Scope of impact

Determines how many customers are affected and whether the issue is isolated or systemic.

#### 1.1 Single-customer impact

**Characteristics:**
- Only one legal entity/customer affected
- Often customer-specific configuration or integration issue
- May be reproducible for other customers if triggered the same way

**Examples:**
- Bad address payload from specific customer
- Customer-specific nexus configuration error
- Customer-specific product mapping issue
- Customer-specific exemption logic error

**Response level:** Account manager handles with manager oversight

**Key question:** Is this truly isolated or could it affect others?

#### 1.2 Multi-customer partial impact

**Characteristics:**
- Subset of customers affected
- Often tied to specific integration, jurisdiction, or feature
- Most dangerous because it looks isolated but is systemic

**Examples:**
- Customers using specific integration (e.g., Shopify only)
- Customers in specific jurisdiction (e.g., CA sourcing rule bug)
- Customers using specific feature (MPU, marketplace logic, reverse charge)

**Response level:** Manager involvement required; potential SWAT team

**Key question:** What's the common factor? How many customers share it?

#### 1.3 Global impact

**Characteristics:**
- All customers or all transactions affected
- Platform-level issue
- Immediate escalation required

**Examples:**
- Tax engine unavailable
- Core ruleset regression
- Address resolution failure
- Rate service failure

**Response level:** Immediate SWAT team activation; executive involvement

**Key question:** How quickly can we contain and resolve?

### 2. Temporal nature

Determines when the issue occurred and how long it persisted.

#### 2.1 Hard downtime

**Characteristics:**
- Tax calculation endpoint unavailable
- Timeouts/5xx errors
- Explicit fail-closed behavior

**Risk profile:**
- Missed tax collection
- Missing invoice fields
- Customer operational blockage
- Highly visible to customers

**Response level:** Immediate; P0 incident

**Key question:** How long was service unavailable?

#### 2.2 Soft downtime

**Characteristics:**
- Calculations occur but are wrong
- More dangerous than hard downtime
- Often detected late

**Examples:**
- Zero tax applied incorrectly
- Wrong jurisdiction sourced
- Wrong rate applied
- Exempt logic misfiring

**Risk profile:**
- Historical correction required
- Compliance implications
- Customer trust impact
- May affect filed returns

**Response level:** High priority; requires immediate investigation

**Key question:** How long before we detected it?

#### 2.3 Intermittent/partial failures

**Characteristics:**
- Only some transactions fail
- Retry-dependent behavior
- Time-window specific

**Risk profile:**
- Hardest to detect and explain
- Difficult to reproduce
- Customer confusion

**Response level:** Moderate to high; requires detailed investigation

**Key question:** Can we identify the pattern?

### 3. Financial exposure magnitude

## Common assessment mistakes

### Underestimating scope

**Mistake:** Assuming issue is isolated when it's actually systemic

**Prevention:**
- Always ask: "Could this affect other customers?"
- Check for common factors (integration, jurisdiction, feature)
- Review recent changes that could have broader impact

### Overestimating urgency

**Mistake:** Treating every issue as critical

**Prevention:**
- Use decision matrix objectively
- Consider actual customer impact, not just dollar amount
- Distinguish between urgent and important

### Delayed escalation

**Mistake:** Trying to handle beyond your authority level

**Prevention:**
- Escalate early when in doubt
- Use escalation triggers as guide
- Better to escalate unnecessarily than too late

### Incomplete assessment

**Mistake:** Starting remediation before full assessment

**Prevention:**
- Complete assessment checklist
- Gather all facts first
- Don't rush to solutions

### Poor documentation

**Mistake:** Not documenting assessment and decisions

**Prevention:**
- Document as you go
- Record key decisions and rationale
- Maintain audit trail

## Assessment tools

### Exposure calculator

```
Total Exposure = Σ (Transaction Amount × Tax Rate Difference)

Where:
- Transaction Amount = Taxable amount per transaction
- Tax Rate Difference = |Correct Rate - Applied Rate|
- Σ = Sum across all affected transactions
```

### Customer impact score

```
Impact Score = (Exposure × Urgency × Relationship Value) / 1000

Where:
- Exposure = Dollar amount
- Urgency = 1 (low) to 5 (critical)
- Relationship Value = 1 (small) to 5 (strategic)

Score > 50 = Executive involvement
Score 20-50 = Manager involvement
Score < 20 = Account manager handles
```

### Remediation complexity score

```
Complexity = (Customers × Jurisdictions × Filing Status × Direction)

Where:
- Customers = Number affected
- Jurisdictions = Number affected
- Filing Status = 1 (pre-filing) or 3 (post-filing)
- Direction = 1 (over) or 2 (under) or 3 (wrong jurisdiction)

Score > 50 = High complexity (SWAT team)
Score 20-50 = Moderate complexity (Manager + team)
Score < 20 = Low complexity (Account manager)
```

Use these tools as guides, not absolute rules. Apply judgment based on specific circumstances.
