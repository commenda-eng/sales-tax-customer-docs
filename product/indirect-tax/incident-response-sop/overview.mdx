## Overview

This document outlines the standard operating procedures for responding to incidents related to indirect tax operations. These procedures ensure consistent, effective handling of tax calculation errors, service outages, and compliance issues.

## Core principles

### Always inform the customer

As a service provider, always inform customers of issues that affect their tax calculations, regardless of dollar amount or visibility. Customers discovering issues after the fact undermines trust in the entire system.

### Tax reimbursement is contractual

Sales tax in the U.S. is a reimbursable tax. The buyer owes the tax to the jurisdiction, and the seller acts as a conduit to collect and remit it. When tax is under-collected, the liability remains with the buyer, not the seller.

### Timeliness matters

The customer's willingness to adjust tax reimbursement diminishes over time. Issues discovered and addressed within the same reporting period are significantly easier to resolve than those discovered years later.

### We don't pay tax

Commenda's liability is limited to service fees paid, not tax amounts. We provide support, documentation, and remediation assistance, but do not reimburse customers for tax liabilities.

## When to use this SOP

Use these procedures when:

- Tax calculation errors are detected (over-collection, under-collection, or mis-sourcing)
- Service outages affect tax calculations
- Integration issues cause incorrect tax treatment
- Exemption certificate processing delays impact transactions
- Address hierarchy or sourcing logic produces incorrect results

## Response framework

All incidents follow a standard response framework:

1. **Detect and classify** - Identify the issue type, scope, and severity
2. **Assess impact** - Determine financial exposure, compliance risk, and customer impact
3. **Execute remedy** - Follow the appropriate remediation playbook
4. **Communicate** - Notify affected customers with clear, actionable guidance
5. **Document** - Record root cause, resolution, and lessons learned

## Incident classification

Incidents are classified into five primary categories:

### 1. Low-dollar, low-visibility issues

Small amounts per transaction spread across many customers. Treated as audit risk rather than immediate remediation.

### 2. Under-collection

Tax under-charged to end customers. Requires customer to re-bill or obtain affidavits.

### 3. Over-collection

Tax over-charged to end customers. Requires refunds and potential amended returns.

### 4. Wrong jurisdiction

Tax collected and remitted to incorrect jurisdiction. Requires amendments in both jurisdictions.

### 5. Tardy exemption certificate

Late or delayed exemption application. Requires amended returns and billing adjustments.

## Escalation thresholds

### Account manager discretion

- Single customer impact
- Exposure < $5,000
- No filings affected
- Recent issue (within current reporting period)

### Executive involvement required

- Multiple customer impact
- Exposure > $10,000
- Filed returns affected
- Issue spans multiple reporting periods
- Customer threatens legal action

### SWAT team activation

- Platform-wide impact
- Exposure > $100,000
- Real-time reporting jurisdictions affected
- Cascading downstream effects
- Regulatory inquiry received
