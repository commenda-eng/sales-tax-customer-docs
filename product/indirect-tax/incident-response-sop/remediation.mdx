## Overview

This playbook provides detailed, step-by-step procedures for remediating each incident scenario. Follow these procedures to ensure consistent, effective incident resolution.

## General response workflow

All incidents follow this standard workflow:

### 1. Initial detection and triage

**Actions:**
- Document how issue was discovered (customer-reported, internal monitoring, filing review)
- Identify affected time window

- Assess immediate containment needs

**Outputs:**
- Incident ticket created
- Initial scope assessment
- Containment actions taken (if needed)

### 2. Impact assessment

**Actions:**
- Identify affected customers
- Calculate financial exposure
- Determine compliance lifecycle impact (pre-invoice, post-invoice, post-filing)

- Evaluate direction of error (under-collection, over-collection, mis-sourcing)

**Outputs:**
- Affected customer list
- Financial exposure by customer and jurisdiction
- Compliance impact assessment
- Scenario classification

### 3. Root cause analysis

**Actions:**
- Identify technical root cause

- Executive involvement in key customer conversations

#### Step 5: Handle filing implications

**Actions:**

**If returns not yet filed:**
1. Ensure correct amounts are reported on upcoming returns
2. Document under-collection and recovery efforts
3. Report actual collected amounts (not amounts that should have been collected)

**If returns already filed:**
