## Overview

This page provides email templates for notifying customers of incidents and supporting their remediation efforts. Customize these templates based on the specific situation while maintaining the core messaging principles.

## Template usage guidelines

### Customization points

Each template includes placeholders in brackets `[like this]` that should be customized:
- `[Customer name]` - Customer's company name
- `[Contact name]` - Primary contact's first name
- `[Your name]` - Your full name
- `[Dollar amount]` - Specific financial figures
- `[Number]` - Transaction counts, time periods, etc.
- `[Jurisdiction]` - State, county, or city names
- `[Date]` - Specific dates or date ranges

### Tone and messaging

- **Be direct and transparent** - Explain what happened clearly
- **Lead with facts** - Provide specific numbers and timelines
- **Emphasize recency** - Highlight that issues were caught quickly
- **Offer support** - Make it clear you'll help them through the process
- **Avoid blame** - Focus on resolution, not fault

### Approval requirements

- **< $5,000 exposure**: Account manager approval
- **$5,000-$10,000 exposure**: Manager approval
- **> $10,000 exposure**: Executive approval

## Template 1: Under-collection notification

Use this template when tax was under-collected and customer needs to recover from their buyers.

### Subject line

```
Follow-up on recent sales tax under-collection
```

### Email body

```
Hi [Contact name],

We identified a recent issue that affected how sales tax was calculated on a [small/limited] number of your transactions. Due to [brief description of root cause, e.g., "an integration issue related to address mapping"], our tax engine under-collected tax on [number] invoices, representing approximately $[amount] in total sales tax.

A few important points to keep in mind:

As a reminder, under U.S. sales tax rules, the tax itself is owed by the buyer, not by [Customer name]. [Customer name]'s role is to remit that tax to the appropriate authorities on the buyer's behalf. When tax is under-collected at checkout, the remaining amount typically needs to be rebilled to the customer so it can be properly remitted.

No previously filed returns have been impacted. All affected transactions are recent [or: occurred between [start date] and [end date]], and the relevant returns have not yet been filed, so this was identified within a relatively timely window.

Our recommended next step is for [Customer name] to rebill the affected customers for the under-collected tax. To make this as straightforward as possible, we'll provide a template email you can use. In summary, that outreach will:

• Explain that there was a temporary issue in the tax calculation logic that resulted in under-collection
• Clarify that the sales tax remains due to the taxing authorities, and that [Customer name] serves as the collector and remitter on the government's behalf
• Ask the customer to either:
  - Pay the additional tax so it can be properly remitted, or
  - Provide confirmation that they have already self-assessed and paid the applicable use tax

We recognize that this is a sensitive customer communication, and we'll support you throughout the process:

• We'll share a clear, auditor-defensible outreach template
• We've attached the exact list of affected invoices, amounts, and jurisdictions for your records
• If helpful, we're happy to review your final email or letter before it's sent
• [For large exposures: We're available to participate in conversations with your customers if that would be helpful]

Please let us know who on your team should receive the customer outreach template, and whether you'd like to schedule a quick call to walk through the specifics.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Attachments to include

1. **Transaction detail spreadsheet** with columns:
   - Invoice number
   - Invoice date
   - Customer name
   - Ship-to address
   - Jurisdiction
   - Taxable amount
   - Tax that should have been collected
   - Tax that was collected
   - Under-collected amount

2. **Customer tax recovery template** (see Template 6 below)

## Template 2: Over-collection notification

Use this template when tax was over-collected and customer needs to refund their buyers.

### Subject line

```
Action required: Sales tax over-collection identified
```

### Email body

```
Hi [Contact name],

We identified an issue that caused sales tax to be over-collected on [number] of your transactions. Due to [brief description of root cause], our tax engine over-collected approximately $[amount] in total sales tax between [start date] and [end date].

Here's what this means for [Customer name]:

The over-collected tax needs to be returned to your customers. You have a few options for how to handle this:

1. Issue credits on future invoices (works well for repeat customers)
2. Process direct refunds (required for one-time customers or large amounts)
3. A combination approach based on customer relationship and amount

We've prepared a detailed breakdown of affected transactions to help you determine the best approach for each customer.

Filing implications:

[If tax not yet remitted:]
Since the affected returns haven't been filed yet, we'll simply report the correct amounts on your upcoming filings. No amendments are needed.

[If tax already remitted:]
Since tax was already remitted to [jurisdiction(s)], we'll need to file amended returns with claims for refund. This process typically takes 3-6 months. We can coordinate the timing of customer refunds based on your cash flow preferences.

Next steps:

1. Review the attached transaction detail to understand the impact by customer
2. Decide on your refund approach (credits vs. direct refunds)
3. We'll provide refund notification templates for your customers
4. [If applicable: We'll prepare and file amended returns]
5. We'll track the process through completion

We're here to support you through this process. Please let us know if you'd like to schedule a call to discuss the best approach for your business.

Best,
[Your name]
```

   - Invoice number
   - Invoice date
   - Customer name
   - Jurisdiction
   - Taxable amount
   - Tax that should have been collected
   - Tax that was collected
   - Over-collected amount

2. **Refund notification template** (see Template 7 below)

## Template 3: Low-dollar, low-visibility issue notification

Use this template when amounts are too small to warrant customer tax recovery.

### Subject line

```
FYI: Minor sales tax calculation issue identified and resolved
```

### Email body

```
Hi [Contact name],

We wanted to make you aware of a minor sales tax calculation issue that affected [Customer name]'s account between [start date] and [end date]. 

What happened:

Due to [brief description of root cause], our tax engine [under-collected/over-collected] small amounts of tax across [number] transactions. The total exposure for your account is approximately $[amount], with an average of $[amount] per transaction.

Why we're not recommending customer outreach:

Given the small dollar amounts per transaction (averaging $[amount]), attempting to recover these amounts from your customers would be impractical and likely cost more in administrative time than the tax amounts involved.

Instead, we recommend treating this as an audit-risk issue:

• The issue has been fully resolved as of [date]
• The likelihood of discovery is low (would only surface if a specific customer is audited)
• We've documented everything for your records
• If this ever comes up on audit, we'll provide full support and documentation

What we've prepared for you:

• Detailed transaction-level documentation
• Root cause analysis
• Timeline of issue and resolution
• Audit defense package (if needed in the future)

No action is required on your part. We're providing this information for transparency and your records. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Attachments to include

1. **Transaction detail spreadsheet**
2. **Root cause analysis document**
3. **Audit defense package**

## Template 4: Wrong jurisdiction notification

Use this template when tax was remitted to the wrong jurisdiction.

### Subject line

```
Sales tax sourcing correction required
```

### Email body

```
Hi [Contact name],

We identified an issue with how sales tax was sourced for [number] of your transactions between [start date] and [end date]. Due to [brief description of root cause, e.g., "an address hierarchy logic error"], tax was collected and remitted to [incorrect jurisdiction] when it should have been remitted to [correct jurisdiction].

The good news:

The total tax amount collected was correct - we just need to move it from [incorrect jurisdiction] to [correct jurisdiction]. This means there's minimal net impact to your business.

What needs to happen:

We'll file two sets of amended returns:

1. In [incorrect jurisdiction]: Amended return requesting refund of $[amount]
2. In [correct jurisdiction]: Amended return paying $[amount] (plus any applicable interest)

Timeline expectations:

• Amended returns will be filed within [timeframe]
• Refunds from [incorrect jurisdiction] typically take 3-6 months
• Payment to [correct jurisdiction] will be processed immediately
• We'll track both processes through completion

Your involvement:

Minimal - we'll handle the amendment process and keep you updated on status. You may need to approve the amended returns and payment, depending on your account setup.

We've attached detailed documentation showing the original sourcing, corrected sourcing, and net impact by jurisdiction. Please let us know if you'd like to schedule a call to walk through the details.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Attachments to include

1. **Sourcing analysis spreadsheet** with columns:
   - Invoice number
   - Invoice date
   - Customer name
   - Ship-to address
   - Original jurisdiction assigned
   - Correct jurisdiction
   - Tax amount
   - Net impact by jurisdiction

2. **Amendment schedules** for both jurisdictions

## Template 5: Tardy exemption certificate notification

Use this template when an exemption certificate was applied late.

### Subject line

```
Exemption certificate applied - amended return required
```

### Email body

```
Hi [Contact name],

We've received and applied the exemption certificate for [customer name]. However, since the certificate was received after transactions were processed and reported, we need to file amended returns to correct the reporting.

Transaction details:

• [Number] transactions were processed as taxable between [start date] and [end date]
• Total tax reported: $[amount]
• Exemption certificate received: [date]
• Exemption certificate is valid for these transactions

What needs to happen:

[If tax was collected:]
1. File amended returns in [jurisdiction(s)] to remove the exempt tax
2. Refund $[amount] to [customer name]
3. Track refund/credit from [jurisdiction(s)]

[If tax was not collected:]
1. File amended returns in [jurisdiction(s)] to remove the exempt tax
2. No customer refund needed
3. Track refund/credit from [jurisdiction(s)]

Timeline:

• Amended returns will be filed within [timeframe]
• [If applicable: Customer refund will be processed within [timeframe]]
• Refunds from jurisdictions typically take 3-6 months

We've updated our system to ensure [customer name] is properly marked as exempt going forward. Please let us know if you have any questions.
