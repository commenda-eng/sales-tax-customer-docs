## Best practices

- **Keep information current**: Update bank details immediately when accounts change
- **Use descriptive names**: If your bank name isn't clear, add location details (e.g., "Chase Bank - Main Street Branch")
- **Verify before saving**: Always double-check account and routing numbers
- **Set a primary account**: Designate one account as primary for streamlined operations
- **Regular audits**: Review your bank accounts quarterly to ensure all information is accurate
- **Match legal names**: Use the exact legal name registered with your bank to avoid payment issues

## Troubleshooting

### I can't save my bank account

**Common causes:**
- Missing required fields (bank name, account number, routing number)
- Invalid routing number format (must be 9 digits for US banks)
- Account number contains invalid characters

**Solution:** Check that all required fields are filled and formatted correctly.

### My account number isn't showing

**This is normal.** For security, account numbers are masked in the dashboard and only show the last 4 digits. The full number is securely stored and used for transactions.

### I need to change my account number

**You cannot edit account or routing numbers after creation.** To update these:
1. Add a new bank account with the correct information
2. Set it as primary if needed
3. Delete the old account

### The primary account won't change

**Check that:**
- You have permission to edit bank accounts
- The new account is fully saved before setting as primary
- You're clicking **Save** after making changes
