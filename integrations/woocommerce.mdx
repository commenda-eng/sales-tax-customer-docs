description: Learn how the WooCommerce plugin works with Rootfi and what data fields are synchronized
---

## Overview

The WooCommerce integration allows Rootfi to connect with your WooCommerce store and synchronize e-commerce data. This integration enables you to access orders, products, customers, and other store data through the Rootfi API.

## How it works

The WooCommerce plugin establishes a secure connection between your WooCommerce store and Rootfi using the WooCommerce REST API. Once connected, Rootfi can fetch and synchronize data from your store at regular intervals or in real-time through webhooks.

### Authentication

The integration uses WooCommerce REST API keys for authentication:

1. Generate API keys in your WooCommerce store (WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > REST API)
2. Provide the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret to Rootfi
3. Rootfi establishes a secure connection using these credentials

### Data synchronization

Rootfi synchronizes data from WooCommerce through:

- **Initial sync**: Complete data fetch when the integration is first established
- **Incremental sync**: Regular updates to fetch new or modified records
- **Webhook sync**: Real-time updates when configured (optional)

### Setup steps

1. **Generate API credentials**
   - Navigate to WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > REST API
   - Click "Add key"
   - Set description (e.g., "Rootfi Integration")
   - Select user with appropriate permissions
   - Set permissions to "Read/Write"
   - Click "Generate API key"
   - Copy the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret

2. **Connect to Rootfi**
   - Log in to your Rootfi dashboard
   - Navigate to Integrations
   - Select WooCommerce
   - Enter your store URL
   - Provide the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret
   - Click "Connect"

3. **Configure sync settings** (optional)
   - Set sync frequency
   - Enable/disable specific data entities
   - Configure webhook endpoints for real-time updates

### Webhook configuration (optional)

For real-time data synchronization, configure webhooks in WooCommerce:

2. Create webhooks for the following events:
   - Order created
   - Order updated
   - Product created
   - Product updated
   - Customer created
   - Customer updated
3. Set the delivery URL to your Rootfi webhook endpoint

## API access

Once the integration is active, you can access WooCommerce data through the Rootfi API:

```bash
GET /api/v1/woocommerce/orders
GET /api/v1/woocommerce/products
GET /api/v1/woocommerce/customers
GET /api/v1/woocommerce/refunds
```

## Limitations

- API rate limits apply based on your WooCommerce hosting environment
- Large catalogs may require longer initial sync times
- Some custom fields may require additional configuration
- Webhook delivery depends on your server configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Connection issues

If you encounter connection problems:

- Verify API credentials are correct
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled on your store
- Check that the REST API is enabled in WooCommerce settings
- Verify firewall rules allow outbound connections

### Sync issues

If data is not synchronizing:

- Check sync logs in the Rootfi dashboard
- Verify the integration status is "Active"
- Ensure the API user has appropriate permissions
- Check for WooCommerce plugin conflicts

### Webhook issues

If webhooks are not working:

- Verify webhook URLs are correct
- Check webhook delivery logs in WooCommerce
- Ensure your server can make outbound HTTPS requests
- Verify the webhook secret matches
