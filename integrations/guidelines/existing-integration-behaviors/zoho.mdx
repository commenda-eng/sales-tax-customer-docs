Zoho supports both calculations and sync. The address implementation looks identical to Quickbooks.

There are two different code paths for Zoho address resolution, one for calculations and one for sync. They are currently implemented differently in a way that may be error-prone, and this should be reviewed.

## Sync:

**Zoho Transactions**: INVOICES, INVOICE_CREDIT_NOTES, CASH_REFUNDS

We use addresses directly from Rootfi. We use the invoice-level shipping address if present, if it is null, we fall back to the invoice-level billing address. We do not do any validation checks on the shipping address, so if it’s non-null but incomplete we will still propagate it forwards.

 Customer-level addresses are not considered.

**Zoho Contacts: **CONTACTS

We record the shipping and billing addresses on the contact, synced through Rootfi.

## Calculations:

We retrieve the transaction from rootfi's passthrough API and then only consider the shipping address, calculating based on it no matter what.
