Quickbooks supports both calculations and sync.

There are two different code paths for Quickbooks address resolution, one for calculations and one for sync. They are currently implemented differently in a way that may be error-prone, and this should be reviewed.

## Sync:

**Quickbooks Transactions**: INVOICES, INVOICE_CREDIT_NOTES, CASH_REFUNDS

We use addresses directly from Rootfi. We use the invoice-level shipping address if present, if it is null, we fall back to the invoice-level billing address. We do not do any validation checks on the shipping address, so if it’s non-null but incomplete we will still propagate it forwards.

 Customer-level addresses are not considered.

**Quickbooks Contacts: **CONTACTS

We record the shipping and billing addresses on the contact, synced through Rootfi.

## Calculations:

We retrieve the transaction from rootfi’s passthrough API and then only consider the shipping address, calculating based on it no matter what.
