Commenda does not support tax calculations in Shopify, the following doc refers only to their sync flow.

**Shopify Transactions **(ECOMMERCE_TRANSACTIONS in Rootfi)

We follow this hierarchy to pick the first non-null address (with no validity checks other than whether the address is null or not):

- Shopify’s transaction shipping address (from raw data)
- Shopify’s transaction billing address (from raw data)

We don’t seem to fall back to a customer-level address if those fields are missing

**Shopify Customers** (ECOMMERCE_CUSTOMERS in rootfi)

We follow this hierarchy to pick the first valid address:

- Rootfi SHIPPING address
- Rootfi BILLING address

We select exactly one of these addresses, geocode it, and sync it to the sales tax API.
