## Overview

Rootfi's WooCommerce integration enables you to seamlessly fetch and synchronize e-commerce data from WooCommerce stores. This integration provides access to orders, products, customers, inventory, and other critical business data.

## How it works

The WooCommerce integration connects to your WooCommerce store using the WooCommerce REST API. Once authenticated, Rootfi can fetch data from your store and keep it synchronized in real-time through webhooks.

### Architecture

1. **Authentication**: Secure connection using WooCommerce API keys
2. **Data fetching**: Periodic synchronization of store data via REST API
3. **Real-time updates**: Webhook notifications for immediate data changes
4. **Data normalization**: Standardized data format across all integrations

## Authentication

### Prerequisites

- WooCommerce store with REST API enabled
- Admin access to generate API credentials
- HTTPS enabled on your store (required for API access)

### Connection process

1. Navigate to your WooCommerce admin dashboard
2. Go to **WooCommerce** \> **Settings** \> **Advanced** \> **REST API**
3. Click **Add key** to generate new API credentials
4. Set the following:
   - **Description**: Rootfi Integration
   - **User**: Select an admin user
   - **Permissions**: Read/Write
5. Copy the generated **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**
6. In Rootfi, provide:
   - Store URL
   - Consumer Key
   - Consumer Secret
7. Test the connection to verify access

### Security considerations

- API keys should be stored securely and never exposed in client-side code
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Regularly rotate API credentials
- Monitor API access logs for suspicious activity

### Webhook configuration

Webhooks are automatically configured during the integration setup:

1. Rootfi creates webhook subscriptions via the WooCommerce API
2. Webhook endpoint: `https://api.rootfi.com/webhooks/woocommerce/{integration_id}`
3. Webhook secret is generated for signature verification
4. Events are delivered in real-time as they occur

### Webhook payload

Each webhook includes:

- `event` - Event type
- `created_at` - Event timestamp
- `resource` - Resource type (order, product, customer)
- `data` - Complete resource data

### Webhook security

- All webhooks are signed with HMAC-SHA256
- Signatures are verified before processing
- Invalid signatures are rejected
- Webhook endpoints use HTTPS only

## Data synchronization

### Initial sync

When you first connect a WooCommerce store:

1. Rootfi fetches all historical data
2. Data is processed in batches to avoid rate limits
3. Sync progress is tracked and resumable
4. Typical sync time: 5-30 minutes depending on store size

### Incremental sync

After initial sync:

1. Webhooks provide real-time updates
2. Periodic polling ensures data consistency
3. Modified records are detected and updated
4. Deleted records are marked as inactive

### Rate limits

WooCommerce API rate limits:

- Default: 25 requests per 10 seconds
- Configurable per store
- Rootfi automatically handles rate limiting with exponential backoff

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**Authentication failed:**

- Verify API credentials are correct
- Ensure REST API is enabled in WooCommerce settings
- Check that HTTPS is enabled on your store
- Confirm the API user has admin permissions

**Missing data:**

- Check that the API user has appropriate permissions
- Verify the data exists in WooCommerce
- Review API rate limits and sync status
- Check webhook delivery logs

**Webhook not receiving updates:**

- Verify webhook is active in WooCommerce settings
- Check webhook delivery logs in WooCommerce
- Ensure firewall allows outbound connections
- Verify webhook URL is accessible

**Sync performance issues:**

- Large product catalogs may take longer to sync
- Consider increasing API rate limits
- Check for API errors in logs
- Monitor server resources

### Support

For additional help:

- Check Rootfi integration logs
- Review WooCommerce system status
- Contact Rootfi support with integration ID
- Provide relevant error messages and timestamps

## Best practices

1. **Regular monitoring**: Check sync status and webhook delivery regularly
2. **API key rotation**: Rotate API credentials periodically for security
3. **Test environment**: Test integration changes in staging before production
4. **Data validation**: Verify critical data after initial sync
5. **Error handling**: Monitor error logs and set up alerts for failures
6. **Performance optimization**: Use webhooks for real-time updates instead of frequent polling
7. **Backup**: Maintain regular backups of your WooCommerce data

## Limitations

- Historical data retention depends on WooCommerce configuration
- Some custom fields may require additional mapping
- Third-party plugin data may not be included by default
- API rate limits may affect sync speed for large stores
- Webhook delivery is not guaranteed (use polling as backup)
